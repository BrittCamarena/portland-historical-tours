				<h1>Site Plan for Portland Historical Tours Website</h1>				
				<h2>Client Questions</h2>

				<ol>
					<li>What did the client say that they want the web site to accomplish? Describe the goal of the  web site in one or two sentences. (purpose of this site)
						<ul class="a">
							<li>The goal of this website is to provide an online portal for visitors to get more information on tours, dates, and events.  Site visitors will also have the ability to book tours and get in direct contact with the company.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

					<li>Who is the intended audience? (who will visit this site)
						<ul class="a">
							<li>Tourists visiting Portland for the first time or existing residents that wish to learn more about their city.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>What opportunity, problem, or issue did you hear that the client wants to address?  (what problem are you solving)
						<ul class="a">
							<li>This company has been in business for 33 years and wishes to reach as many people as possible. Thus, a website is appropriate to communicate our thorough experience with touring and provide a simple access point for interested customers.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>What does the client want the site visitors to do? (action(s) the user should perform)
						<ul class="a">
							<li>Learn more about our business and book tour reservations online.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>List and provide working links to at least two related or similar sites found on the Web and explain why you think they are related. These can be the ones listed in the documents above *or* any other sites you find on the Internet that seem to
						address a similar need. Look at those sites on the Internet, then answer two questions: a) What did you like about those other websites? b) What did you not like (what do you think you could do better?)  (competitive analysis)
						<ol type="a">
							<li><a href="http://www.portlandwalkingtours.com/">Portland Walking Tours</a>
								<ul>
									<li>Pros: The site provides clear information on the offered tours and has an easily navigable format. Tour overviews are concise and to-the-point.</li>
									<li>Cons: Website styling is grossly outdated and impersonal to the content at hand. Pictures should be provided to catch visitors' eyes, create atmosphere, and pique interest.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><a href="https://www.wildwoodtours.com/">Wildwood Adventures</a>
								<ul>
									<li>Pros: This site is beautifully crafted and has top-notch navigation and overall aesthetic. Tour information and services are presented very clearly.</li>
									<li>Cons: Homepage image carousel is too large and distracting for new visitors. The available tours shown when you scroll down should be visible upon first visit.</li>
								</ul>
